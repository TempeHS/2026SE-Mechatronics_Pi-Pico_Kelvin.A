# Roboptimus Prime


Roboptimus prime is a robot which is able to complete a maze, utilising a set of ultrasonic sensors, colour sensors, servos, and a oled screen. It's purpose is to be able to safely navigate a maze without crashing, and also to stop, wait a few seconds and continue its loop, when the colour green has been detected.

## Description
Roboptimus prime is a microcontroller-based robot utilising Raspberry Pi Pico. It is equipped with **Ultrasonic Sensors** to detect distance from the front and side, **Servo motors** for directional movement, a **Colour sensor** to detect the colour green, and an **OLED display** for visual feedback. The overall use of the robot is for autonomous navigation environments, like a maze-solving competition.
